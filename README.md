# game-license-plate

While looking out for the ride we booked, there was a discussion about how best to quickly and accurately identify our ride from the sea of vehicles, assuming no description of the vehicle is given besides the vehicle license/number plate information.

The strategies discussed were:
* Matching the numerical part of the license plate first, then checking the letters
* Matching the letters first, then checking the numerical part of the license plate

This simple game was then created to determine the superior strategy.
